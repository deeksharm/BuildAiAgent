# LangGraph Agent on Azure AI Foundry

A minimal, editable ReAct-style agent built with LangGraph, using an Azure AI
Foundry model deployment (via Azure OpenAI) as the LLM.

## 1. Get your Azure AI Foundry values

In the [Azure AI Foundry portal](https://ai.azure.com):

1. Open your project → **Deployments** → note the **deployment name** of the
   chat model you deployed (e.g. `gpt-4o`).
2. Go to your project's **Overview** or the underlying Azure OpenAI resource
   → **Keys and Endpoint** → copy the **endpoint** and **key**.

## 2. Set up the project in VS Code

```bash
# from the folder containing agent.py
python -m venv .venv

# activate it
source .venv/bin/activate        # macOS/Linux
.venv\Scripts\activate           # Windows (PowerShell: .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1)

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

In VS Code:
- Install the **Python** extension (ms-python.python) if you don't have it.
- `Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P` → "Python: Select Interpreter" → choose the `.venv` you
  just created.

## 3. Configure credentials

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Edit `.env` and fill in your real values:

```
AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT=https://<your-resource-name>.openai.azure.com/
AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION=2024-10-21
AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME=<your-deployment-name>
```

`.env` is loaded automatically by `python-dotenv` in `agent.py` — don't commit
it to source control.

## 4. Run it

```bash
python agent.py
```

Try prompts like:
- "What's the weather in Seattle?"
- "What's 23 * 17 + 4?"
- "What's the weather in Austin, and also what's 100 / 4?"

You'll see the agent call the `get_weather` or `calculator` tools
automatically when needed, then respond with a final answer.

## How it's structured

- **Tools** (`get_weather`, `calculator`) — plain Python functions decorated
  with `@tool`. Replace these with your real integrations (internal APIs,
  databases, search, Azure AI Search, etc.).
- **`AzureChatOpenAI`** — the LangChain wrapper that talks to your Azure AI
  Foundry deployment.
- **`StateGraph`** — defines the agent's control flow explicitly:
  - `agent` node: calls the LLM, which decides to answer directly or call a
    tool.
  - `tools` node (`ToolNode`): executes whichever tool(s) the LLM requested.
  - `tools_condition`: routes to `tools` if the LLM asked for a tool call,
    otherwise routes to `END`.
  - The graph loops `agent -> tools -> agent` until the LLM gives a final
    answer with no more tool calls.

## Extending this

- **Add more tools**: write a new `@tool`-decorated function and add it to
  the `tools` list.
- **Add memory/persistence across sessions**: swap `graph_builder.compile()`
  for `graph_builder.compile(checkpointer=...)` using LangGraph's
  `MemorySaver` or a SQLite/Postgres checkpointer.
- **Multi-agent / supervisor pattern**: if you need multiple specialized
  agents coordinated by a router, that's a different graph shape (a
  supervisor node routing to sub-agent nodes) — let me know if you want that
  version instead of the single ReAct agent above.
- **Streaming**: use `graph.stream(...)` instead of `graph.invoke(...)` to
  stream tokens/steps back to a UI.
- **VS Code debugging**: add a `launch.json` with a `"program": "agent.py"`
  Python configuration to set breakpoints inside tool functions or the graph
  nodes.
